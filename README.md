\## ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game in Java



Welcome to my simple number guessing game! This is one of my early Java projects, built to practice loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation. Itâ€™s a console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

\- How to use `Scanner` for user input

\- How to generate random numbers with `Random`

\- How to use loops and conditionals to control game flow

\- How to handle input bugs (like `nextInt()` vs `nextLine()`)

\- How to write clear and readable code with proper formatting

\### ðŸŽ® Game Rules

\- The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.

\- You get \*\*2 attempts\*\* to guess the number.

\- After each guess, youâ€™ll be told if your guess is too high or too low.

\- If you guess correctly, you win!

\- If not, the correct number is revealed.

\- You can choose to play again or exit.

\### ðŸŒ± Why I Built This

This project is part of my journey to master Java fundamentals. Iâ€™m learning how to build small, interactive programs and gradually improving my coding style, logic, and confidence. I plan to add more features like score tracking or difficulty levels in future versions!
